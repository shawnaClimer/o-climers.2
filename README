use command "make master slave" to compile both programs

my program attempts to create slave processes and have each one iterate a given number of
times. On each iteration, the child process accesses a shared memory integer, increments it,
and prints to an output file. I used a chunk of shared memory to hold an array of integers to
use for the bakery algorithm. The first int in the array is the choosing flag. Programs can 
enter in to choose their "number" if no one else is currently choosing.

my version control is at https://github.com/shawnaClimer/o-climers.2

things that don't work properly:
1) control c will prevent master from forking any more children, but it does not clean up shared
memory that is still attached to by children.
2) bakery algorithm seems to hang program after the children finish iterating. I ran out of time
to figure out how to fix it.
3) I realized in class that I had the "wait" check in master in the for loop, so it was waiting 
for each child to terminate before forking another. I moved it outside the for loop, but it needs
to be changed to work right.
